# Nirvati OS - Raspberry Pi Edition

This is the optimized operating system for Nirvati, based on Raspberry Pi OS.


## 🔧 Advanced

**Config variables**

The `config` file has system defaults which are used when building the image and for automated builds.

- `CITADEL_VERSION` - To install the specific [Citadel](https://github.com/runcitadel/core) version.

- `GITHUB_USERNAME` - To automatically login to your node without typing a password.

- `CITADEL_REPO` - A custom git repo used to download Citadek. `CITADEL_VERSION` is ignored if this is set, but it is required to also set `CITADEL_BRANCH`.

- `CITADEL_BRANCH` - The git branch or commit SHA in the custom repo that should be checked out.

Other pi-gen-related stuff can be found in [pi-gen's documentation](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/master/README.md) which is still applicable.

### ⚡️ Don't be too reckless

> Citadel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
